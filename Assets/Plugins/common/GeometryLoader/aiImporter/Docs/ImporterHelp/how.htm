<p>If you take a look at the Importer folder in the Assets/aiImporter directory of your Unity project, you will notice an executable called AssimpImporterFull.exe (AssimpImporterFree.exe for demo).
I will call that exe aiImporter from now on. We run the aiImporter via Process.Start method using Unity scripting. We give two parameters to Process.Start : output file name and the path of the model we want to load.
If we give "FileDialog" as the second parameter aiImporter will open up a file browser for us to choose the model file.</p>

<p>aiImporter runs separately from Unity. It will load the selected model from the file browser or from the given path and get datas such as vertices, uvs, normals, skeleton/skinning data and anything necessary. After that it will
create a file. The name of the file is the first parameter you passed to Process.Start, it is "scene.bin" by default. 
This scene.bin file is the serialized version of the <a href="GameScene.htm">GameScene</a> class. We will deserialize it and assign it to a variable using Unity scripting. The scene.bin file is 
deleted after it is assigned to a variable. Then we will use all of the data to create our model in Unity scene.</p><br>

<p>aiImporter just serves the purpose of converting the model to a format that we can read using Unity scripting, so no there is no documentation for it.</p><br>

<p>The process of deserializing the file and creating a procedural mesh is documented in Unity script files. </p>
